# Micrograd Security Policy

## Overview

Micrograd is a minimalistic educational library designed to help users understand neural networks and backpropagation. This security policy outlines best practices for maintaining and using Micrograd securely.

## Secure Coding Practices

- **Follow Secure Coding Guidelines**: Developers should adhere to secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and improper data handling.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed by peers to identify and address potential security issues.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update third-party dependencies and monitor them for known vulnerabilities.

## Data Security

- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that any data processed by Micrograd is anonymized or synthetic. Avoid using sensitive or personally identifiable information.
- **Data Handling**: Users should securely handle and store data files. Avoid exposing sensitive data, especially in shared or public environments.

## User Guidelines

- **Safe Usage**: Micrograd is intended for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use. Users should avoid exposing Micrograd applications to the internet without proper security controls.
- **Environment Security**: Run Micrograd in isolated environments (e.g., virtual machines or containers) to minimize risk. Keep operating systems and Python environments updated.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

- **How to Report**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us immediately. Use the following contact methods:
  - **Email**: [security@micrograd.org](mailto:security@micrograd.org)
  - **GitHub Issues**: [GitHub Repository Issues](https://github.com/micrograd/micrograd/issues)
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## Incident Response

- **Handling Reports**: Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will investigate and address it as promptly as possible. Critical issues will be patched and disclosed with an accompanying security advisory.
- **Updates**: Security patches and updates will be released as necessary, with information provided in release notes and security advisories.

## Compliance

- **Licensing**: Ensure compliance with the licensing terms of third-party libraries and dependencies used by Micrograd.
- **Legal Considerations**: Micrograd is provided for educational purposes only. We disclaim liability for any issues arising from its use in production environments.

## Security Awareness

- **Education and Training**: We provide resources to help users understand secure coding practices and data handling. Stay informed about best practices in machine learning and AI security.

## Continuous Improvement

- **Feedback**: We welcome feedback from the community to improve the security of Micrograd. Share your thoughts and suggestions via the GitHub repository or email.
- **Policy Updates**: This security policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect new threats and best practices.

Thank you!
